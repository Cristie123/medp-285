				<h3>Nolan was raised by an American mother and a British father, and his family spent time in both Chicago and London. As a child, he attended Haileybury, a boarding school just outside London. From a young age Nolan was interested in moviemaking and would use his father’s Super-8 camera to make shorts. He was influenced by George Lucas’s Star Wars trilogy and by the immersive dystopian films of Ridley Scott.</h3>

                <h2>Career</h2>
                <p>After attending University College London, where he studied English literature, Nolan began directing corporate and industrial training videos. At the same time, he was working on his first full-length release, <em>Following</em> (1998). The film centers on a writer going to dangerous lengths to find inspiration; it took Nolan 14 months to complete. On the strength of its success on the festival circuit, he and his producer wife, Emma Thomas, moved to Hollywood.</p>

                <h2>Famous Works</h2>
                <p>Nolan gained international recognition with his second film, <em>Memento</em> (2000), and transitioned into studio filmmaking with <em>Insomnia</em> (2002). He became a high-profile director with <em>The Dark Knight</em> trilogy (2005–2012), and found further success with <em>The Prestige</em> (2006), <em>Inception</em> (2010), <em>Interstellar</em> (2014), and <em>Dunkirk</em> (2017). After the release of <em>Tenet</em> (2020), Nolan parted ways with longtime distributor Warner Bros. Pictures, and signed with Universal Pictures for the biographical thriller <em>Oppenheimer</em> (2023), which won him Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture.</p>
                <p>Nolan's work regularly features in the listings of best films of their respective decades. Infused with a metaphysical outlook, his films thematise epistemology, existentialism, ethics, the construction of time, and the malleable nature of memory and personal identity. They feature mathematically inspired images and concepts, unconventional narrative structures, practical special effects, experimental soundscapes, large-format film photography, and materialistic perspectives. He has co-written several of his films with his brother, Jonathan, and runs the production company Syncopy Inc. with his wife, Emma Thomas.</p>
