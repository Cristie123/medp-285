    <h2>The History of Mauve</h2>
    <p>Mauve, a soft purple hue, has an interesting history tied to the development of synthetic dyes. In 1856, chemist William Henry Perkin accidentally discovered mauve while attempting to synthesize quinine, a treatment for malaria. His experiment led to the first aniline dye, which produced a vibrant purple shade. Perkin patented the dye and started mass-producing it, making mauve the first synthetic dye to be commercially available. This discovery revolutionized the textile industry, as mauve became a fashionable color in Europe, particularly in the 1860s. Its popularity helped advance the field of organic chemistry and paved the way for modern dyes.</p>

        Another fun fact about mauve is that it played a role in the development of modern medicine.
