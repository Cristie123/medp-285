			<p>Selective breeding has occurred for thousands of years in numerous domesticated species, not just dogs. In our canine friends, breeding for specific behavioral traits instead of conformational traits occurred first. However, where and when certain types of dogs originated is still uncertain.

                For example, when looking at different breeds of herding dogs, the Cell Reports study found something unexpected. When they compared the genetics of several well-known breeds of herding dogs, the researchers found that one group of dogs had its origins in the United Kingdom, another from Northern Europe, and yet another group from Southern Europe; the team thought they would be more closely related. When the researchers looked closer, they realized each group used a different strategy to herd their flocks, a pattern that was borne out in the genetic data. This supports the growing theory that multiple human populations started the purposeful breeding of dogs independently.</p>

            <p>Most dog breeds we recognize today were developed in the last 150 years, spurred by what‚Äôs become known as the Victorian Explosion. During this time in Great Britain, dog breeding intensified and expanded, resulting in many of our most recognizable breeds of dogs.

                The Victorians were influenced Darwin‚Äôs ideas of natural selection and became passionate about breeding for the ideal of a certain breed. Many of the conformational traits we think of as classic for a certain type of dog have their origins in this era.</p>

			<p>Genetic studies indicate that the grey wolf is the closest living relative of the dog.[5][16] Attempting to reconstruct the dog's lineage through the phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences from modern dogs and wolves has given conflicting results for several reasons. Firstly, studies indicate that an extinct Late Pleistocene wolf is the nearest common ancestor to the dog, with modern wolves not being directly ancestral to it. Secondly, the genetic divergence (split) between the dog's ancestor and modern wolves occurred over a short period of time, so that the time of the divergence is difficult to date (referred to as incomplete lineage sorting). This is complicated further by the cross-breeding that has occurred between dogs and wolves since domestication (referred to as post-domestication gene flow). Finally, there have been only tens of thousands of generations of dogs since domestication, so few mutations between dog and wolf have occurred; this sparsity makes the timing of domestication difficult to date.</p>
