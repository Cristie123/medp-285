    <h2>color</h2>
    <p>Mauve color is often referred to by historians as the color that changed the world. Why? Because of the inquisitive young student William Henry Perkin. During his search for a malaria cure in 1856, Perkin discovered the first synthetic dye in an intense purple shade. He called it mauveine. </p>
    <h2>Culture</h2>
    <p>Now known as Perkin’s mauve, the color democratized purple, a hue previously associated with royalty. Soon, garments in a mauve color were soon seen in the best houses of Paris and London. Queen Victoria and Empress Eugenie also championed the mauveine aesthetic. With time, Perkin’s mauve discovery became such a commercial hit that the 1890s came to be known as the “mauve decade.” </p>

    <h2>Symbol</h2>
    <p>The wide availability of mauve garments in the latter half of the 19th century somewhat tarnished its regal luster. However, the mauve color remains a symbol of sophisticated taste and nobility.Nowadays the mauve color’s meaning has gathered a dust of nostalgia: it is associated with romance, valor, knighthood, and idealism. Ubiquitous in interior design and wedding invitations, mauve color is a grounded feminine color that intrigues and enchants onlookers.</p>       
    <h2>Tone</h2>
    <p>Mauve, with its soft and sophisticated tones, is a color that bridges tradition and modernity. Its blend of pale purple and pink exudes subtle elegance and a sense of refinement. The versatility of mauve color shines in design, whether paired with neutrals for understated elegance or bold hues like gold for a luxurious touch. Combine color mauve with earthy greens for a natural balance, or use it with metallic accents to create striking and contemporary visuals. The possibilities within a mauve color palette are endless.</p>
    <h2>Created</h2>
    <p>The synthetic dye mauve was first so named in 1859. Chemist William Henry Perkin, then 18, was attempting to synthesize quinine in 1856; quinine was used to treat malaria. He noticed an unexpected residue, which turned out to be the first aniline dye. Perkin originally named the dye Tyrian purple after the historical dye, but the product was renamed mauve after it was marketed in 1859.[8][9] It is now usually called Perkin's mauve, mauveine, or aniline purple.</p>
    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <p>Earlier references to a mauve dye in 1856–1858 referred to a color produced using the semi-synthetic dye murexide or a mixture of natural dyes. Perkin was so successful in marketing his discovery to the dye industry that his 2000 biography by Simon Garfield is simply entitled Mauve. Between 1859 and 1861, mauve became a fashion must-have. The weekly journal All the Year Round described women wearing the colour as "all flying countryward, like so many migrating birds of purple paradise".Punch magazine published cartoons poking fun at the huge popularity of the colour: "The Mauve Measles are spreading to so serious an extent that it is high time to consider by what means [they] may be checked."</p>
    <h2>Replaced</h2>
    <p>But, because it faded easily, the success of mauve dye was short-lived; by 1873, it was replaced by other synthetic dyes.[15] As the memory of the original dye soon receded, the contemporary understanding of mauve is as a lighter, less-saturated color than it was originally known.[16]</p>The 1890s are sometimes referred to in retrospect as the "Mauve Decade" because of the popularity of the subtle color among progressive artistic types, both in Europe and the US.</p>
    <h2>Purple</h2>
    <p>Once the color of Caesar’s and Catholic cardinals’ robes, purple was long associated with royalty and being “born to the purple.” The source of this Tyrian purple was the eastern Mediterranean, where two mollusk species had been harvested for its production since the era of the Phoenicians. Making the dye was painstaking and stinky work that virtually drove the gastropods to extinction—hence the change to red robes for cardinals.</p>
    <h2>UK</h2>
    <p>In the 1850s, purple was still a fashionable color, but the mollusks were no longer an option. The best source in the United Kingdom, then the world’s textile capital, was murexide. Although named in honor of the Murex snail, it was actually derived from guano. That’s right: bird excrement. Scholar Anthony S. Travis, in his telling of Perkin’s story, writes that murexide gave a brilliant color, but it “faded quickly in the heavily polluted, sulfurous city air.”</p>
    <h2>Perkin</h2>
    <p>Perkin was the assistant to the head of the Royal College of Chemistry. In the lab he’d set up in his parents’ loft, he either intentionally or accidentally stained a piece of cloth in the brilliant purple solution he came up with after adding alcohol to the oily mess he’d created from the aniline in coal tar. He couldn’t remove it by washing. He realized this color, which “resisted the action of the atmosphere, light, and soap,” had tremendous potential.</p>
   <h2>Tyrian</h2>
    <p>He initially labeled it Tyrian purple, to capitalize on history. He soon switched to calling it mauve, after the French name for the mallow flower. France is where dyers and textile printers eagerly adopted his new color, driven in part by the monopoly on a lichen-derived purple that was their only other option. The fact that Perkin hadn’t been able to get a patent in France probably helped with its rapid acceptance, too.
