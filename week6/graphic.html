                <p>One of the most praised elements of Detroit: Become Human is its incredibly realistic character models. The game uses advanced motion capture technology to capture detailed facial expressions and body movements. This gives the characters a lifelike appearance and enhances the emotional impact of the story, allowing players to feel connected to the androids and humans they encounter.

                    The facial animations are particularly impressive, with subtle expressions that change based on the situation, emotions, and decisions made in the game. Every twitch of the eye, frown, or smile is meticulously animated, adding depth to the characters.</p>
                <div><img src="images/09.avif" width="600"></div>
                <p>The game adopts a cinematic style, blending gameplay and cutscenes seamlessly. The camera angles, lighting, and composition resemble those of high-budget movies, creating a visually engaging experience. Detroit: Become Human often uses dynamic lighting and depth of field effects to create a filmic atmosphere, enhancing both dramatic and action-filled moments.</p>
                <div><img src="images/11.jpg" width="600"></div>
                <p>The game is set in a futuristic version of Detroit, and the environments are richly detailed. From the sterile, high-tech labs to the run-down urban streets, each location is crafted with a high level of care. The environments are not only visually stunning but also packed with interactive elements that players can explore. Reflections, weather effects like rain and fog, and intricate details in everyday objects make the world feel alive and believable.

                    The city is presented as a mix of futuristic technology and familiar urban decay, with neon-lit streets, towering skyscrapers, and industrial zones creating a vivid depiction of a future where humans and androids coexist.</p>
                <div><img src="images/10.jpg" width="600"></div>
				<p>On platforms that support 4K resolution and HDR (High Dynamic Range), such as the PlayStation 4 Pro and PlayStation 5, Detroit: Become Human offers stunningly sharp visuals. The enhanced resolution improves the clarity of details, while HDR provides richer colors and deeper contrast, making the lighting and shadows even more striking.</p>

		        <p>Aside from facial animations, the overall animation quality is excellent. Characters move fluidly, whether theyâ€™re performing everyday tasks or engaging in high-intensity action scenes. Androids are portrayed with slightly stiff, controlled movements at times, which subtly reminds the player of their non-human nature.

                    In summary, Detroit: Become Human stands out for its top-tier graphics, combining highly detailed character models, expressive animations, and a richly designed world. The attention to detail in lighting, textures, and cinematic presentation creates a visually striking and immersive experience that helps bring the emotional, story-driven gameplay to life.</p>
