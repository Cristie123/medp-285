				<p>Detroit: Become Human is an adventure game played from a third-person view, which is subject to a set and controllable perspective. There are multiple playable characters who can die as the story continues without them; as a result, there is no "game over" message following a character's death. The right analogue stick on the DualShock controller is used to interact with objects and observe one's surroundings, the left is for movement, and R2 scans an environment for possible actions; the motion controls and touchpad are also employed. Via quick time events and dialogue decisions, the story will branch out depending on which choices are made. These can be viewed in a flowchart during and immediately after a given chapter; the player can rewind to certain points in the story to reshape decisions in the event of regret. Certain scenes feature countdowns, which force quick action. Levels abound with magazines for players to read.

                <p>The playable characters are:</p>
                    
                <p>Connor, a police investigator android tasked with hunting down androids that have deviated from their programmed behaviors.</p>
                <p>  Kara, a housekeeper android who develops artificial consciousness and becomes responsible for a young girl's safety.</p>
                    <p>   Markus, a caretaker android who, after gaining consciousness, takes it upon himself to free others like him from bondage.</p>

                    <p>The game is known for its branching narrative structure. Players make choices throughout the game in dialogue interactions, actions, and quick-time events (QTEs). These decisions cause significant shifts in the story, which can be seen in a flowchart at the end of each chapter. The player can rewind to certain points in the story if they regret any decisions, reshaping the outcomes.</p>

		        <p>Multiple Endings: Due to its branching narrative, Detroit: Become Human has multiple endings, determined by the player's decisions. The paths taken by Connor, Kara, and Markus lead to different conclusions, which can result in peaceful resolutions or violent outcomes, depending on how events unfold.</p>
				<p>Flowchart Mechanic: The game incorporates a flowchart system, allowing players to view the different branches and choices they've made during each chapter. This feature helps players understand how their decisions affect the story and encourages replayability to explore alternative outcomes.</p>
