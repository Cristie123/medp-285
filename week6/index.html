	    		<h2>History</h2>
		        <h3>Detroit: Become Human is a 2018 adventure game developed by Quantic Dream and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. It was released for the PlayStation 4 in May 2018. Quantic Dream released a port for Windows under license from Sony in December 2019. The plot follows three androids: Kara (Valorie Curry), who escapes her owner to explore her newfound sentience and protect a young girl; Connor (Bryan Dechart), whose job is to hunt down sentient androids; Markus (Jesse Williams), who devotes himself to releasing other androids from servitude. The player's choices affect the course and outcome of the story. </h3>

				<p>Detroit: Become Human is based on Quantic Dream's 2012 technology demonstration Kara, which also starred Curry. To research the setting, the developers visited Detroit, Michigan. Writer and director David Cage completed the script in over two years. An engine was built to complement the game and hundreds of actors were cast before shooting and animation. Philip Sheppard, Nima Fakhrara, and John Paesano served as composers for Kara, Connor, and Markus, respectively.

					Detroit: Become Human received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the setting, visuals, story, main characters, the quality of motion capture and voice acting, the impact choices had on the narrative, and flowchart feature, but criticised the motion controls, mishandling of historical and thematic allegories, and aspects of the plot and characters. It is Quantic Dream's most successful launch and best-selling game, at 11 million units sold by December 2024.</p>
