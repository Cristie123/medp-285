                <p>zodiac, a belt around the sky extending 9° on either side of the ecliptic, the Sun’s apparent annual path, which contains 12 constellations or astrological signs. In astrology, the outcome of an event (most notably, someone’s birth) is affected by the zodiacal positions of the Sun, the Moon, and the planets when that event happened. The orbits of the Moon and of the naked-eye planets also lie entirely within the zodiac.</p>

                <h2>&diams;Origin
                </h2>
                <p>As early as the 14th century BC a complete list of the 36 Egyptian decans was placed among the hieroglyphs adorning the tomb of Seti I; they figured again in the temple of Ramesses II, and characterize every Egyptian astrological monument. Both the famous zodiacs of Dendera display their symbols, identified by Karl Richard Lepsius.</p>
                <p>With modern astronomy we now understand that the planets of the solar system orbit around the Sun in roughly the same plane. Since the Earth is just one of those planets sharing the same plane, from our perspective the Sun, the Moon, and all the other planets march around the sky following roughly the same path, a wide belt extending from horizon to horizon. This band is known as the zodiac. </p>
                <p>We also know from modern astronomy that the constellations are figments of our imagination (with beautiful, meaningful stories attached to them, but still figments). Stars that appear to be associated with each other can be thousands of light-years apart, but projected on our sky they can resemble people, animals, or familiar objects.</p>
                <p>And so it’s no surprise that ancient astronomers believed that there was a significant connection between the two. The paths of the Sun, Moon, and planets don’t cross in front of every constellation, and so in a cruel, random, and violent world, perhaps there was some important lesson to be learned by that coincidence.</p>
                <p>Almost every culture on Earth has developed some form of astrology, which attempts to use the positions of heavenly objects to predict the fortunes of our lives. In Western traditions, the practice of astrology coalesced around an analysis of the zodiac and the constellations along that band. Beginning thousands of years ago in ancient Babylonia, astronomers divided the zodiac into equal-sized areas, each one corresponding to a constellation. That tradition made it to the Greeks, who passed it on to the Romans, who spread it throughout Europe.</p>
                <p>The most popular expression of zodiac-based astrology is through these “signs” of the zodiac; specifically, the relationship of the Sun to those signs. When you ask someone what their sign is, you’re really asking where the Sun was located in the sky on the date of your birth, and which constellation of the zodiac it was closest to. Of course astrological systems can become much more complicated than that, but if you read a horoscope in the newspaper, that’s the fundamental idea.</p>
